This project consists of four subdirectories:

- [[file:myssd_sdk]]: The device-side runtime of SODA
- [[file:storpu]]: The device-side library that contains the offloaded compute logic
- [[file:mcmqhost]]: The host-side userspace driver and applications
- [[file:postgres]]: The patched version of PostgreSQL 14.6 that supports SODA offloading

The system_wrapper.xsa is used by the myssd_sdk.

Build instructions are available in their respective README files.
