** Getting started
1. In ~scripts/create_projects.tcl~, change the line ~set XSA_FILE ...~ to the path of the XSA file generated by Vivado.

2. From Vitis's XSCT console, run
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   %source <project root>/scripts/create_projects.tcl
   #+END_SRC
   This will generate the platform project as well as three application projects for the FTL, the flash interface layer and the ECC engine, respectively.

3. From the project root, run
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   ./scripts/populate_workspace.sh <Vitis workspace folder>
   #+END_SRC
    This will set up links from the project folders in the Vitis workspace to the source directories.

4. Build the ~nvme_ftl_system~ project in Vitis.

5. Right click the ~nvme_ftl_system~ project in Vitis, "Run As" -> "Run configurations...", double click "System Project Debug" to add new a run configuration ~SystemDebugger_nvme_ftl_system~. Under the "Target Setup" tab, deselect "Use FSBL flow for initialization" and select "Reset APU", "Reset RPU", "Enable RPU Split Mode", "Run psu_init" and "PL Powerup". Press "Run" to run the project.
