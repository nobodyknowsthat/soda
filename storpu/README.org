#+TITLE: SODA Device Library

* Prerequisites
Make sure Python 3.10 is available on the system and install Python dependencies:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
pipenv --python 3.10
pipenv install
pipenv shell
#+END_SRC

* Building the library
The device library can be built using:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cross.cmake
make
#+END_SRC

This will be the device library =lib/libtest.so= and its symbol definition header =lib/libtest_symbols.h=. The device library should be passed to the host applications through command line. The symbol definition header should be added to the include directories when building the host applications.
